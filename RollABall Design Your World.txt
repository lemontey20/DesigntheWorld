Game Rules for Roll A Ball - LEMONTEY Alice
24/11/20 

Collectables:
- 3 types. Their type (defined randomly) is unknown before collision.
- all types: when collision whith the player, it disappears with a sound depending of its type
- type 1 : the player win X1 game points
- type 2 : the player win X2 game points + the player wins Y1 life points
- type 3 : the player win X3 game points + the player wins Y2 life points + inverted chase period begins

Inverted chase period:
- a time counter appears with Z1 seconds
- all enemies become chased
- at each second the time counter decreases
- during the Z2 last seconds, the color of the counter is different
- when the time counter equals 0, all the enemy become idle again

Enemy chased behavior:
- it color changes (same as collectables)
- it moves as at its idle state
- when collision with the player, it disappears 

Game play is tuned with X1, X2, X3, Y1, Y2, Y3, Z1, Z2 values

Starting parameters : 
- Games Points X1 = 10
- Games Points X2 = 20
- Games Points X3 = 30
- Life Points Y1 = 1
- Life Points Y2 = 2
- Time Counter Z1 = 10
- Last chasing seconds Z2 = 3
- Hitting a "not chased" ennemy = -1 life point
- Speed = 10
